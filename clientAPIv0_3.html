            <p class="subhead">listenUpdates( group, callback )</p>

            <p>listenInputs() returns a list of fields of group data that has been updated by the host.</p>

            <div class="specs">
                <p>Parameters:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>group</b> : <em>string</em></li>
                    <li><b>callback</b> : <em>function</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Returns: nothing</p>
            </div>

            <p>The required <b>group</b> is the name of the group to which inputs are to be listened for.</p>
            <p>The required <b>callback</b> parameter must take an object.</p>
            <p>The object passed to callback has a member <b>timestamp</b> that is a number representing the time the response was sent in unix time.</p>
            <p>The object passed to callback has a member <b>response</b> that is a response code.</p>
            <p>response is K.OK if the data was successfully retrieved.</p>
            <p>response is K.UNAUTH if the account could not be authorized.</p>
            <p>response is K.INVALID if the account does not exist or a group with the given name does not exist.</p>
            <p>response is K.ERROR the server could not be accessed or the response was corrupted.</p>
            <p>The object passed to callback has a member <b>body</b> that is an array of strings that are the names of fields that have been updated.</p>

            <p class="subitem">Usage notes</p>

            <p>1. The callback maybe called multiple times as new updates are received because this function refreshes itself.</p>

            <p class="subitem">Return value</p>

            <p>getGroupData returns nothing, but the callback function is called asynchronously when it completes.</p>
