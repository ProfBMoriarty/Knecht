open up two instances of it.

first click on the red side and wait until "you are the client" appears

In the other instance click on the blue side and wait until "you are the host" appears

In the one that says "Host" press enter, that is the one that runs submitUpdates (pressing enter for the "client" instance runs submit inputs).
